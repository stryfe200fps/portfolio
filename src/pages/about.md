### I'm Adrian Radores

Hi, I'm Adrian Radores, but you can call me Adi. I'm a 28-year-old web developer who loves tinkering with stuff and working on web programming projects. I've been in the industry since February 2017 and enjoy exploring new technologies and tools to enhance my workflow.

I have experience in designing and building systems from scratch, as well as upgrading legacy systems to the latest technologies. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing the guitar and table tennis. I'm always up for a challenge and a fun time.

I'm currently looking for clients who need a skilled and reliable web developer to collaborate with. If you have a project that requires my expertise, feel free to contact me.
